Asteroid Data Analysis Project (Completed at age 14)
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of real-world asteroid orbital data to explore patterns and relationships based on Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion. Cleaned and processed real-world data using Python with pandas and Jupyter Notebooks, examined correlations with orbital period, including finding correlation coefficients, and built a polynomial regression model. Key findings include a weak correlation between eccentricity and orbital period, verification of Kepler's third law, and analysis of asteroid characteristics grouped by brightness. Produced visualisations of orbits using Python's matplotlib library, demonstrating a robust understanding of data analysis and visualisation. Used python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn) and handled data in Jupyter Notebooks.
