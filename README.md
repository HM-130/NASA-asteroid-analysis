# Asteroid Data Analysis Project  
*(Completed at age 14)*

## Overview
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of real-world asteroid orbital data to explore patterns and relationships based on Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion. This project involved data cleaning, processing, and analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Details
- **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Used Pythonâ€™s `pandas` library to clean and process raw asteroid data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Examined correlations in orbital data, including calculating correlation coefficients and testing Kepler's third law.
- **Polynomial Regression Model**: Built a regression model to study the relationship between orbital eccentricity and period.
- **Visualizations**: Created visualizations of orbital paths and asteroid characteristics using `matplotlib`, showcasing data trends and analysis results.

## Key Findings
- **Weak Correlation**: Discovered a weak correlation between eccentricity and orbital period.
- **Verification of Kepler's Third Law**: Verified patterns consistent with Kepler's third law through data analysis.
- **Asteroid Characteristics**: Analyzed asteroid properties based on brightness, grouping data accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- **IDE**: VSCode
- **Languages and Libraries**: Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks for data handling and visualization

This project demonstrates a strong foundational understanding of data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques in Python.
